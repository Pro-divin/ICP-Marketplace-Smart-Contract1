DFX, short for "The DFINITY Canister SDK," is a software development kit (SDK) provided by the DFINITY Foundation. It's designed to simplify the development of decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Internet Computer (IC), which is a blockchain-based decentralized network created by DFINITY.

Below are the links and commands you can run in your terminal depending on the type of OS  you are using.(linux,windows or mac)
 
 
Linux

 After installing WSL in your windows pc,  go to the search box in windows then search turn windows features on or off. Then make sure Hyper -v and Windows subsystems for linux are checked, then click okay and your pc will require you restart.

INSTALL NODE IN WSL

First install NVM using this command

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

After installing nvm  restart your shell and run this command to install node in your WSL
nvm install node
 
-       	NODE INSTALLATION LINK as Setup
 https://nodejs.org/en/download
 
-       	dfx
 
 
https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/#installing-dfx
There is no native support for dfx on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run dfx also on a Windows system as described below.
 

 If you are using Windows Subsystem for linux (WSL) , you will need to install the WSL,Remote wsl extensions in your VS Code and connect it to your WSL you have installed in your windows pc.
 
This is the guidance for connecting WSL and VS code

Once you have WSL installed, you can install dfx by running this command below:
 
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
 

 

 

 
Mac
 
-       	Here is an installation  tutorial for mac users https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDMHUdo7m-k&t=467s

 Run this command  on terminal üëç
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
 
Developer Tasks

After successfully installing node.js,vs code  and dfinity software development kit (dfx)  Now you can build your first DApp ..

On internet computer you can build using  5 available SDKs as it listed below üëç
  How to  Build First DApp using Motoko
 
  Run this command to create a default DApp with Motoko
 
 
 dfx new project_name
 
               How to Build First DApp using Azle

Run this command to create a default DApp with Motoko

 npx azle new project_name 

Here project_name you will have to write the name of your project you want to build.

According to the language you have used above, if it is Azle or Motoko, These  commands will generate all default and necessary files to deploy your first DApp including  sample codes.

  1. Navigate the created folder (will be named as the name you have specific while creating a new project using Motoko or Azle) and open it in vs code.
  2. Open vs code terminal then run this command to deploy your DApp

   dfx start ‚Äìbackground ‚Äìclean   dfx deploy
 
 
After successfully deploying your DApp you will  then get  the green link to browse your DApp including  your canister ID.
